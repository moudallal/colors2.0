## Welcome to the remastered version of my super cool portfolio website!
The first portfolio website which you can check [Colors v1](https://www.github.com/moudallal/colors-v1) had lots of bugs, mobile responsivness issues, basically, I was just a beginner when I made that website but it was good enough back then.
Here's a newer, more stable, and more mobile friendly version of it.

## Open-Source code credits
I wanna thank Matt for this amazing javascript library [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) and of course, Bootstrap for their famous framework. Other than these, each line of code was hard coded by myself from scratch.

## Inspiration
The main idea of the website, the color changer, was inspired by [Cubezapp](https://github.com/unixpickle/cubezapp).

## TODO
- [x] Get a custom domain and link it to my repo here on github.
- [ ] Get a custom email address with Google that matches my custom domain.

## Credit me!
I open sourced this code so you guys out there can check it out. But if you manage to use any idea, chunk of code, or design of my website, I ask you to credit me on your page.
